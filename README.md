# âš½ Player & Referee Identification and Tracking using YOLO + DeepSORT + Face Recognition

This project implements real-time detection, tracking, and re-identification of football players, referees, goalkeepers, and the ball using a YOLO-based object detector, DeepSORT tracker, and facial recognition. It aims to assign consistent IDs to individuals across frames even when occluded or partially visible.
